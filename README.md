# How to highlight the lunch hours in the Flutter Calendar?

Using the Calendar's [specialRegions](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/calendar/timslot-views#special-time-regions) property, you can highlight the time slot for lunch hour in the Flutter Event Calendar.

In this sample, the time regions are added as lunch hours in the Flutter Calendar by using the startTime and endTime properties of the time region.
